# NYC Taxi Data – BigQuery Practice

This repository contains my practice work using Google BigQuery
(Sandbox mode) with the NYC Yellow Taxi dataset (Jan–Jun 2024).

## Tools
- Google BigQuery (Sandbox)

## What I Did
- Uploaded monthly Parquet files
- Combined them into a single table
- Ran analytical SQL queries
- Explored columnar storage behavior and query cost estimation

## Limitations
- External tables were not used because BigQuery Sandbox
  does not allow Cloud Storage access without billing

## Status
Learning in progress 🚧
